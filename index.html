<h3>Project #1</h3>
<h2>For my first project, I wanted to go for a mix of hand drawn digital art with a mix of graphic logo design. To achieve this, I hand drew the background, and added the building and skyline in illustrator. To fill the art more and make the image more immersive, I added the reflection off of the water which proved a little more challenge than I thought, but was still not to complicated a task. I played with colors to establish a calming feeling, and felt these colors would bring out the back skyline more. Overall, i'm happy with my final results.</h2>

<h3>Assignment #2</h3>
<h2>For this project, I was able to pick a font that I felt fit quickly, but making the font line up was the somewhat difficult part. The "G" always felt somewhat out of place to me, and I had to tweak it as much as I could in seperation from the rest of the word. The color was also A little harder to pick, because I wanted it to both stand out and blend with the rest of the canvas. In the end, I feel like the font fits perfectly with the mood of the overall project.</h2>

<h3>Assignment #3</h3>
<h2>For my third project, I feel like I spent most of my time figuring out how to do more simple things than working on the story for my twine game. I wanted to take a simple occurance like snow and make it seem unusually darker the more you played the game. I ended up keeping it rather simple in the long run so that the user could be able to go back and play through a few of the other options.</h2>
